# Physics-Quiz
Repository for the Physics quiz webpage.
The non-"README" files are the important ones.

Those three are the template. To make use of them will require some editing. I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to do this in one file/page. Using this method, we can create a set of files where each "landingtwo" can redirect back if wrong or forward to the next "landing", assuming we still want them to do the activities in a specific order. We can kind of leave it similar to how it currently is if we want to instead let them choose thier own order, but it would be a score based, not speedy challenge, then.

The page I found this on is https://webdevtrick.com/simple-quiz-in-php-source-code/.

Also, it is important to note that the quiz as it is in the template is multiple choice. This can be changed using text boxes. Additionally, anything inside <php> here </php> is processed by the server and invisible to the user if they attempt to inspect the page.
